    <h1 id="head">FD Interest Rates</h1>
    <p>One of the best ways to secure your money is by investing in fixed deposits which not only helps you to save money but also helps you to earn a substantial interest in it. Competitive Bank FD interest rates help the depositor to get a good Return on Investment over a fixed tenure. Under the fixed deposit scheme, the depositor deposits the money only once at the time of opening the account. The interest rates offered depends on the bank, deposit amount and the tenure you choose.

        At the end of the tenure, the interest accrued is calculated on the principal amount and the total amount is paid back to the depositor. The tenure of fixed deposits may range from 7 days to 10 years. In the next section, we have enlisted some of the banks that offer competitive interest rates.</p>

      <p><h1>Fixed Deposit Interest Rates - Senior Citizens</h1>

        All the banks usually offer slightly higher interest rates than what is offered to general citizens. However, to get a senior citizen account and avail of the benefits, one has to submit age proof. The deposited money moves in between the savings account and the fixed deposit account. It is usually known as Sweep in-Sweep out fixed deposit. This scheme allows the depositor to earn higher interest rates on the surplus amount in their savings account.
        <br><br>
        *The age of senior citizen must be 60 or more at the time of opening the account.
        <br><br>
        * Senior citizens' FD tenure ranges from 7 days to 10 years in most of the banks
        <br><br>
        * A senior citizen FD can give you an interest rate between 0.25% to 0.75% higher One can take loans against their senior citizen FD account than the regular interest
        <br><br>
        * Like other schemes, senior citizen FD also levies penalty in case of premature
        withdrawal</p><br><br>
        <p><h1>Important Terms Related to Fixed Deposit Interest Rates</h1><br>
            Timely Closure: Timely closure refers to closing the fixed deposit account at the time of its maturity only. When closed upon maturity date, the bank pays back the principal amount with the interest accrued over the tenure chosen.
            <br><br>
            Breaking FD account: It’s just the opposite of timely closure where the depositor withdraws the entire deposited money before the maturity. Usually, breaking of FD or premature withdrawal is not allowed and is subject bank’s norms; banks levy a penalty at the time of breaking your FD before the maturity date and pays you back the principal amount and the interest at a lower interest rate. However, there are some banks such as Yes Bank and Bank of Maharashtra that waive off the penalty if the withdrawal is due to some emergency.
            <br><br>
            Partial Withdrawal: As the name suggests, partial withdrawal allows the depositor to withdraw a certain part of the money from the fixed deposit account. You can either use the fund for some emergency or get it deposited in some other bank in case you are getting the best FD rates in the market. Usually, it is allowed in the units of Rs. 1000 and a penalty of 1% is levied by the bank. However, the remaining balance amount continues to earn the original interest rate

            <br>
            Where,
            <br><br>
            I = A – P
            <br>
            A = Maturity amount
            <br>
            P = Principal amount
            <br>
            r = rate of interest
            <br>
            t = Tenure
            <br>
            n = Compounded interest frequency
            <br>
            I = Interest earned</p><br><br>
